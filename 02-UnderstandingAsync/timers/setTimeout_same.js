/*
One would expect that function b would execute after function a. However, this
cannot be guaranteed â€” a may follow b, or the other way around.
Additionally, there exists a minimum wait time of one millisecond for a timeout.
Passing a value of zero, -1, or a non-number will be translated into this minimum
value.
